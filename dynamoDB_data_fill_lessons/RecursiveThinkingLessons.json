Shut up! Will you shut up?! Now, look here, my good man. Listen. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government.

Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you do not have to spend any time working or worrying. How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That is your challenge for the day. Every day I learn. Let us make a nice big leafy tree. And just raise cain. I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring. Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals. We do not really know where this goes - and I am not sure we really care. Use what happens naturally, do not fight it."
