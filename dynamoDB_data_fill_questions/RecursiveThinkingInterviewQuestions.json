Look, just because I do not be giving no man a foot massage do not make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwone into a glass motherfucking house, fucking up the way the nigger talks. Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better paralyze my ass, because I will kill the motherfucker, know what I am saying"
